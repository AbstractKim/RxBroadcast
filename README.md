# RxBroadcast
Reactive `Broadcast` and `LocalBroadcast` for Android.

# Usage
#### System Broadcast
`Observable<Intent> = RxBroadcast.fromBroadcast(context, intentFilter);`

#### LocalBroadcast
`Observable<Intent> = RxBroadcast.fromLocalBroadcast(context, intentFilter);`

# Unregistering
Be sure to unregistering your receiver, this is typically done in the `Activity.onStop()`, by simply unsubscribing from your earlier subscription.

`Subscription subscription = RxBroadcast.fromLocalBroadcast(context, intentFilter).subscribe(...);`

...
```
  @Override
  protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();

    if (subscription != null) {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    }
  }
```
